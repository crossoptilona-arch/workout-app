A5 · Balance Circuit
2 ROUNDS · 30S REST BETWEEN EXERCISES
Structure: Do Exercise 1 → rest 30s → Exercise 2 → rest 30s → Exercise 3 → rest 60s → repeat round.
Exercise 1: Tandem Stance — 20-30 seconds each foot
Stand near a chair. One foot directly in front of the other, heel touching toe. Fix gaze on a point straight ahead — stable gaze dramatically improves balance. Hold 20-30 seconds each foot.
Too easy: close eyes for 5-second intervals. Too hard: widen stance slightly.
Exercise 2: Single-Leg Stand — 20-30 seconds each side
Fingertips on chair only. Lift one foot slightly off the floor. Fix your gaze. Hold 20-30 seconds. Switch.
Progression: two-finger → one-finger → hover → no touch. Move only when current level feels controlled.
Exercise 3: Weight Shifts — 10 reps each direction
Hands lightly on chair. Slowly shift weight to right foot until left foot lightens. Hold 3 seconds. Shift left. Repeat.
Progress to actually lifting the unloaded foot 1-2 inches off the ground.
Safety rule: Always have a chair, wall, or counter within one arm's reach. Touch support the instant you feel unsteady. There is no benefit to falling.
